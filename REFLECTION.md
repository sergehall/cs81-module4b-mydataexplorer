## Were your predictions right?

Mostly, yes. I predicted that Saturday would have the most screen time, and that turned out to be true. I also guessed that Tuesday would be my most focused day, and the data supported that as well. However, I thought more caffeine would equal better focus, and the results were mixed — some high-caffeine days had lower focus levels.

## What surprised you?

I was surprised to see how little correlation there actually was between caffeine and focus. I expected a clearer pattern. Also, I didn’t expect Sunday to show such high focus with very low caffeine intake.

## What was tricky or rewarding?

Writing the correlation logic was a bit tricky — it required filtering and averaging subgroups of data. It was rewarding to see meaningful results after breaking the problem into smaller parts. Creating reusable and readable functions gave me more confidence in working with real-world data.

## How did using your own data change things?

Using personal or realistic data made the project feel more engaging and relevant. I wasn’t just writing random functions — I was analyzing patterns that reflect real habits. This made debugging and interpreting the results more meaningful and easier to connect with.
